# RUW
RUW stands for Random Unsplash Wallpaper.
It downloads random image from unsplash.com using their https://source.unsplash.com/ service.
It allows users to choose which category to download the image from.

RUW is work in progress. So far it works only on some Windows machines and blocks the UI while downloading the image because it is done on a single thread.
